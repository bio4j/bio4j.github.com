We have just submitted to the [bioRxiv][bioRxiv] a citable preprint describing Bio4j:

- **[Bio4j: a high-performance cloud-enabled graph-based data platform][Bio4j preprint]**

which we hope will serve as a good introduction to what is Bio4j, and what it has to offer; especially so if, for getting a general idea of Bio4j, you would rather read prose than code. If you are using Bio4j for something that you want to publish, citing it is much easier now; all bioRxiv preprints are assigned a DOI and ...

We will be submitting a paper based on this preprint to an open access journal.
