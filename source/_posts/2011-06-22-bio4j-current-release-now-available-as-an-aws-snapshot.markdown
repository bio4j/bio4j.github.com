For those using [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com) (or willing to...) I just created a public snapshot containing the last version of Bio4j DB.
The snapshot details are the following:

- Snapshot id: `snap-25192d4c`
- Snapshot region: EU West (Ireland)
- Snapshot size: 90 GB

The whole DB is under the folder `bio4jdb`.
In order to use it, just create a [Bio4jManager](http://www.bio4j.com/docs/bio4jmodel/apidocs/com/era7/bioinfo/bio4jmodel/util/Bio4jManager.html) instance and start navigating the graph!

As always, any feedback/comment/question is more than welcome, 
(post a comment here or a question in the [user group](http://groups.google.com/group/bio4j-user)).
