## Bio4j: a roadmap


### new data integrated

*ETA?*

- ucsc human genome data, other genomic data
- reactome
- ...

### Data release and distribution improvements

*ETA?*

- in-sync automated data import and releases
- improve usability from AWS
- standard data import brings easier in-house deployment tool

### A Scala API

*ETA?*

- based on Scarph, the work of the nice guys at [oh no sequences!](http://ohnosequences.com). If you're working (or plan to) work with graphs in Scala, definitely keep an eye on this!!
- incredibly expressive super typed
- completely interoperability with the Java API in terms of data
- AWS deployment based on Statika

### Angulillos improvements

*ETA?*

- use any Tinkerpop3 backend! use Bio4j with virtually _any_ graph db
- extend angulillos with more sophisticated combinators for traversals

### Automated testing?

*ETA?*
