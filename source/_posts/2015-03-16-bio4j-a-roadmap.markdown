# Bio4j: a roadmap

> The scope for this is: what's going to happen during 2015 in Bio4j. Right now this is just a list of points I want covered. Feel free to add / remove things, or comment in the commits if you prefer.
> 
>  **ETA**: Estimated time of arrival

## New data

- **ETA?** Human genome data, other genomic data. support for stabbing queries etc
- **ETA?** [Reactome](http://www.reactome.org/)

## Scala API

- **ETA?** based on Scarph, the work of the nice guys at [oh no sequences!](http://ohnosequences.com). If you're working (or plan to) work with graphs in Scala, definitely keep an eye on this!! Incredibly expressive super typed. Complete interoperability with the Java API in terms of data
- **ETA?** AWS deployment based on [Statika](http://ohnosequences.com/statika)

## Release and data distribution improvements

- **ETA?** in-sync automated data import and releases, every 6 months. Predictable, stable, coherent, automated.
- **ETA?** small testing data subset based on SwissProt.
<!-- - standard data import brings easier in-house deployment tool -->

## Java API improvements

- **ETA?** extend angulillos with more sophisticated combinators for traversals
- **ETA?** use any Tinkerpop3 backend! use Bio4j with virtually _any_ graph db

## Documentation

- **ETA?** examples for every graph, model docs integrated with the source code
