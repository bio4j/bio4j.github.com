Hi all!
So summer has almost come to an end and I have now time again to continue with the development of Bio4j project. 
This autumn comes with plenty of new features that will be released in the next few months; the first of them: git-flow model.
Bio4j is moving forward fast and it was already time to organize its development, supporting it with an adequate model. Here is where git-flow comes in, providing a simple but yet powerful development model where releases, features, hot-fixes... can be managed without having to go crazy putting them all together. 
Here you have a general schema of the model:

Since [@nvie](http://twitter.com/nvie) wrote a really good post explaining the details of his model, I'll just provide [this link](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to it  instead of giving a much poorer explanation than the one in the article.
