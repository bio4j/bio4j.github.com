We are really excited to announce that **Bio4j** has been **accepted** as a [mentoring organization](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2014/bio4j) for **[Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014)**. This was the first year we applied for it, and it feels just great being part of this inititative!

We think this is a great opportunity for students, giving them the opportunity to hack on pretty cool stuff around graph databases, bio big data and cloud computing.

## how to participate

If this sounds amazing and you are a student (PhD, masters, undergraduate, [whatever](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page#2._Whos_eligible_to_participate_as_a)) or know someone who is,

1. **[check our ideas list](https://github.com/bio4j/gsoc14/wiki/ideas)** and then
2. **contact a potential mentor** or if you don't know who just [@eparejatobes](https://github.com/eparejatobes) or [@pablopareja](https://github.com/pablopareja)

You can read more about it in the [bio4j/gsoc14 wiki](https://github.com/bio4j/gsoc14/wiki).
