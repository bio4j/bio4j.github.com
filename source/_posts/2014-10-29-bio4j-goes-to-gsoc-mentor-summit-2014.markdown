I just got home yesterday from San Francisco after attending to the 10th edition of the Google Summer of Code mentor summit. It's been a great experience that I would like to share with you all in this blog post ;)
For those of you who still don't know what [GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1) is, here's a debrief: 
> Google Summer of Code is a program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source projects. We work with many open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund projects over a three month period. 

This was Bio4j's first year as a GSoC organization and we got three students who work in the following projects:

- [dynamograph](https://github.com/bio4j/dynamograph)
- [exporter](https://github.com/bio4j/exporter)
- [el-grafo](https://github.com/bio4j/el-grafo)

It also was my first experience as a mentor and I must say that I both learned and enjoyed it a lot during the process.
