Hello everyone!

As a person who is working on one of the amazing project - Dynamograph - I want to present it to you.

## What is Dynamograph?

Dynamograph is one of the bio4j projects realized under Google summer of code programme. What is more important it is implementation of graph database based on [DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). This project was designed for storing biological data but it could be used for every type of data.
Word Dynamograph comes from connection of two words: DynamoDB and Graph. Each of them are equally important as express two different things:
** first part indicates that project is based on Amazon's Key Value database - technological information
** 'graph' part reveal type of structures that could be stored and effectively managed - functional information

## Why it is extremely interesting

First of all Dynamograph is an unique application of DynamoDb for storing biological data within graph topology. It enables storing whole graph structures in database and successfully operating on desired parts of graph.
What is more this project benefits from characteristics of DynamoDB as a fundamental technology which results in great performance.
Another important fact is that it operates on some really interesting datasets. There you can find support for things like: Gene Ontology, NcbiTaxonomy etc.

## My experience

Working on Dynamograph is great pleasure for me. I am not only writing something unique, extraordinary but also learn lots of amazing things.
I've done something in Scala before, but thanks to participation in this project I started using some advanced features like: abstract types, shapeless library, implicits, type classes, etc.
What is also great, working with giant amount of data gives a lot of satisfaction and encourage you to "constantly thinking how to do it better".
Of course working on software product is not only coding but also several different activities. There I could get to know interesting process for software development and acquire knowledge about biological data.
All those things make me extremely glad that I could working on this project.


If you found this project interesting and want to read something more about it please go to the [project site](https://github.com/bio4j/dynamograph).
There you could not only learn how it works but also express your opinion and start contribution.

Everybody who wants to work on cool stuff and learn a lot of useful things should definitely contact with bio4j.
