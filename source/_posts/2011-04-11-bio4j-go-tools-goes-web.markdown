Hi!

From now on Bio4j Go Tools is available at the following [address](http://gotools.bio4j.com:8080/Bio4jTestServer/Bio4jGoToolsWeb.html).

This new version includes a chart for GO annotation terms frequency visualization. Some of the new chart features are:

- GO terms search by name
- Independent ontology chart visualization
- Links to terms gene-ontology sites

In order to visualize your results just click on the "load file" button and select a XML file you previously generated using the GO Annotation service available in the first tab of the app.
