So the moment is approaching for Bio4j!

I'm updating the platform indexing system right now, putting it up to date with the new [index API](http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Index_Framework) for Neo4j. Once this change is made, there won't be any other obstacles in the way for Bio4j to be launched...

Just wait a couple of days more...
