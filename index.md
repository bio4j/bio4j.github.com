Bio4j is a bioinformatics graph data platform, integrating most data available in [**Uniprot KB**](http://www.uniprot.org/) (SwissProt + Trembl), [**Gene Ontology**](http://www.geneontology.org/) (GO), [**UniRef**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniref/) (50,90,100), [**NCBI Taxonomy**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/), and [**Expasy Enzyme DB**](http://enzyme.expasy.org/). 

Bio4j provides a completely new and powerful **framework for protein related information querying and management**. 
The use of a graph-based data model makes possible to store and query data in a way that semantically represents its own structure. On the contrary, traditional relational models and databases must flatten the data they represent into tables, creating _artificial_ ids in order to connect the different tuples; which can in some cases eventually lead to domain models that have almost nothing to do with the actual structure of data.
